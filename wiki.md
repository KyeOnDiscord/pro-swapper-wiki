# FAQ
Frequenty Asked Questions

Does Pro Swapper Ban?
Pro Swapper doesn't ban as it's undetected

Does Pro Swapper work on GeForce Now?
No, we are unable to edit the files on the GeForce Now remote machine.

Other people can't see my skin ingame!
The swapper is client sided which means that only you are able to see it because of the way that Fortnite processes skin data. Others can see it in lobby (if the skin has the locker icon) but not in-game

Does Pro Swapper work on PS4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Mobile?
The swapper is only available for Windows. (Most recommended on Windows 10)

# Swapper Not Opening

If the swapper isn't opening:
Turn off your anti virus, turn off real time protection from Windows security. (Most people have their anti virus on)
If the swapper is still not opening try putting it in a different folder (or your desktop)
If there is a .NET error or something like that try installing the 4.6.1 .NET framework [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461 "Microsoft's .NET 4.6.1 framework")

If you get a network error try using a vpn. Proton VPN is a good free vpn.

# Stuck on starting
If it's stuck on starting:
Restart the swapper but if that doesn't work try the following:

1. Verify Fortnite from Epic Games Launcher (Learn how [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7eQxQhQr0))
2. Open Pro Swapper
3. Goto the settings tab
4. Click "Mark items as off" (This marks all items as not converted as Verifying Fortnite makes your game files before you used the swapper)
