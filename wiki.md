# FAQ
Frequenty Asked Questions

Does Pro Swapper Ban?

Pro Swapper doesn't ban as it's undetected

Does Pro Swapper work on GeForce Now?
No, we are unable to edit the files on the GeForce Now remote machine.

Other people can't see my skin ingame!
The swapper is client sided which means that only you are able to see it because of the way that Fortnite processes skin data. Others can see it in lobby (if the skin has the locker icon) but not in-game

Does Pro Swapper work on PS4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Mobile?
The swapper is only available for Windows 10, we are currently not planning to release it on any other platforms.

Why do skins have no head?

Some skin's have no head as the method we use to swap skins limits the amount of parts we can swap.

Why do I keep getting kick out of the game?
You swapped too many items. Try swapping 1 item at a time

# Swapper Not Opening

If the swapper isn't opening:
Turn off your anti virus, turn off real time protection from Windows security


# Stuck on starting
If it's stuck on starting:
Restart the swapper but if that doesn't work try the following:

1. Verify Fortnite from Epic Games Launcher
2. Open Pro Swapper
3. Goto the settings tab
4. Click "Mark items as off"
You can only swap 1 skin & 1 pickaxe at the same time. If you want to use backblings you must only swap a backbling.
If you're using the skins at the bottom (the different section) you must only swap that skin
