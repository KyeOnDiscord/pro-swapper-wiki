Does Pro Swapper Ban?

Pro Swapper doesn't ban as it's undetected

Does Pro Swapper work on GeForce Now?
No, we are unable to edit the files on the GeForce Now remote machine.

Other people can't see my skin ingame!
The swapper is client sided which means that only you are able to see it because of the way that Fortnite processes skin data. Others can see it in lobby (if the skin has the locker icon) but not in-game

Does Pro Swapper work on PS4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Mobile?
The swapper is only available for Windows 10, we are currently not planning to release it on any other platforms.

Some skin's have no head as the method we use to swap skins limits the amount of parts we can swap.
