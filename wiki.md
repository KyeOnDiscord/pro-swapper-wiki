# FAQ
Frequenty Asked Questions

Does Pro Swapper Ban?
Pro Swapper doesn't ban as it's undetected

Does Pro Swapper work on GeForce Now?
No, we are unable to edit the files on the GeForce Now remote machine.

Other people can't see my skin ingame!
The swapper is client sided which means that only you are able to see it because of the way that Fortnite processes skin data. Others can see it in lobby (if the skin has the locker icon) but not in-game

Does Pro Swapper work on PS4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Mobile?
The swapper is only available for Windows. (Most recommended on Windows 10)

Why do skins have no head?
Some skin's have no head as the method we use to swap skins limits the amount of parts we can swap.

Why don't backblings work with skins / Why are backblings invisible on skins?
It's just how skin swapping works, there is no way to fix this, however the skins which show as default in lobby have their backbling ingame.

# Swapper Not Opening

If the swapper isn't opening:
Turn off your anti virus, turn off real time protection from Windows security.
If the swapper is still not opening try putting it in a different folder (or your desktop)
If there is a .NET error or something like that try installing the .NET framework [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472 "Microsoft's .NET 4.7.2 framework")

# Stuck on starting
If it's stuck on starting:
Restart the swapper but if that doesn't work try the following:

1. Verify Fortnite from Epic Games Launcher (Learn how [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7eQxQhQr0))
2. Open Pro Swapper
3. Goto the settings tab
4. Click "Mark items as off" (This marks all items as not converted as Verifying Fortnite makes your game files before you used the swapper)

# Errors

This error which kicks you from the match with the message: "You were removed from the match due to erros in your installation. Please verify or reinstall Fortnite to correct these issues"

This message means you swapped **too** many items.
### Swapping Guidelines
It's **recommended** to swap **1** skin and **1** pickaxe at max
If you want to swap an emote you should swap it by itself, same with backblings
You can experiment to see which items and how many of them kick at a certain point but the guidelines above should be fine.


**You must not use lobby items or the lobby swapper at the same time as the ingame swapper or the error below will occur**

If you're unsure on what to do, do the following if you're still getting kicked out:
1. Verify Fortnite from Epic Games Launcher (Learn how [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7eQxQhQr0))
2. Open Pro Swapper
3. Goto the settings tab
4. Click "Mark items as off" (This marks all items as not converted as Verifying Fortnite makes your game files before you used the swapper)
5. Swap the item(s) you want with the guidelines above

**Emote Error**

This error occurs when you swap an emote and when you ready up it shows up with this message and closes Fortnite. This is because you put the **swapped** emote into your main 6 locker emotes. **DO NOT** put the swapped emote into your locker, when you go ingame you have to scroll and find the swapped emote.
