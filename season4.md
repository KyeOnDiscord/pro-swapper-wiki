Pro Swapper Season 4 is swapping custom skins/items using a private server (Aurora) and the Fortnite 14.20 (Season 4) client.

Aurora has been Shutdown so we recommend using Neonite

# FAQ

Can I join other people?

No, as the Fortnite server is hosted locally on your machine.

Can I go ingame?

Neonite doesn't support matchmaking

Do I have to download 14.20?

It's a bit tedious, we know but the most recent version of Fortnite compresses their files so custom skins are the easiest on this version without the compressed files.
